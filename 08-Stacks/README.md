# ðŸ“š Stacks 

It follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added to the stack is the first to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates where you can only add or remove plates from the top.

ðŸŒ± **Main Operations:**

1. **Push**: Adding an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop**: Removing the top element from the stack.
3. **Peek (or Top)**: Viewing the top element without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**: Checking if the stack is empty.
5. **Size**: Determining the number of elements in the stack.

ðŸŒ± **Common Uses:**
- Function call management in programming (call stack).
- Undo/redo functionality in applications.
- Parsing expressions, such as checking for balanced parentheses. 
- Implementing algorithms like depth-first search in graph traversal.
